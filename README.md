## System Architecture

The project adopts a frontend-backend separation architecture:

1. **Frontend**:
   - React single-page application responsible for user interface and interaction
   - State management using Redux, with RTK managing API requests and local state
   - Component design follows the "separation of concerns" principle, with components like StatusBadge managing UI state independently

2. **Backend**:
   - Node.js API service handling business logic and data storage
   - RESTful API design following resource-oriented principles
   - Multi-layer data model enabling flexible user-job relationship management

3. **Browser Extension**:
   - Implements automatic collection of job information from recruitment websites
   - Seamless integration with the main system
